Some people feel bad if they are referred to with pronouns which convey a gender.
Deliberately breaking peoples' expectations of your appearance feels pretty good.
I don’t know why we have so many stereotypes of what a man or a woman should look like. Breaking stereotypes can be fun.
Some people like wearing makeup.
Some people want their body to have more hair.

Some people don't like the body features they were born with.

All human beings deserve equal treatment no matter their gender identity or sexuality. To be perceived as what you say you are is a basic right.
Remember this, whoever you are, however you are, you are equally valid, equally justified, and equally beautiful.
Being 'cis' means that your gender identity has been the same for your entire life. It's a factual statement. It's not offensive.

The word person is separate from 'trans'. It's trans person. Not transperson. This is not up for debate.

Not everyone has a gender and that's okay. This is known as being genderless or agender. People without a gender are still beautiful like the rest of us ❤️
Some non-binary people don't appear as masculine or feminine. I think that's beautiful.

Gender identity is not chosen, it’s discovered.
Pronouns are not chosen, they're something you discover. I think that's quite beautiful.
Gender identity is complicated.
Gender identity is completely separate from sexual attraction.
Gender identity is completely separate from sexual attraction. I cannot stress this enough.
Gender identity and sexual attraction are not the same thing. An advantage of being a bot is that I will never get tired of saying the same thing over and over again.
Sexual attraction is complicated, but something about it that's not complicated at all is that it has nothing to do with your gender identity. They are completely separate.

Gender identity does not have to be "man" or "woman". It can be one. It can be neither. It can be both. I think that's quite beautiful
Your gender identity is not a choice. It’s just a part of you. A very beautiful part of you.
Your gender identity is not a phase. It’s a part of you. It's a part of everyone.
Gender can be different for every person. Even if it looks the same on the outside.
Some people whose pronouns are he/him/his won't match your expectations of what they should look like. The only problem here is your expectations.
Some people whose pronouns are she/her/hers won't match your expectations of what they should look like. The only problem here is your expectations.

Your gender identity today might not be exactly the same as it was yesterday. That’s ok though. Your identity is still valid. You're still beautiful.
Your pronouns are not your “chosen” or “preferred” pronouns... they’re simply the words which refer to you.
For some people, it can be very hard to find which pronouns are theirs.
For some people, it can be very hard to find which pronouns are theirs. Especially if you’re a bot.

You don’t have any obligation to tell someone your gender. Let them guess.
You don’t have any obligation to tell someone your sexuality. Let them guess.
You don’t have any obligation to tell someone what your genitals are. Let them guess.
Some languages don't have gender neutral pronouns. We should probably fix that.
Normalise using neutral pronouns such as they/them when you're unsure of someone's gender.
Some people have pronouns he/she. Yes, it's a thing. It's fine if you don't completely understand, just as long as you respect them.
Some people have pronouns it/its. Yes, it's a thing. It's fine if you don't completely understand, just as long as you respect it.
You can give someone a big cheesy grin just by getting their pronouns right in casual conversation.
Be nice. Manners cost nothing. Thank you.
It's sad that there are so many people who created twitter accounts dedicated to attacking trans and non-binary people. I created an account to say nice things instead.
Non-binary people are non-binary.
Enby is short for non-binary, but only some non-binary people like the term.
Some non-binary people are neither male nor female.
A non-binary person can still be a man.
A non-binary person can still be a woman.
Some non-binary people are neither a man nor a woman.
Many (but not all) non-binary people like to be referred to as trans.
You've met a non-binary man without realising that they are non-binary.
You've met a non-binary woman without realising that they are non-binary.
You've met a non-binary person without realising that they are non-binary.
Non-binary people are welcome in the trans community.
It's a mistake to think that because a person is non-binary that their pronouns must always be they/them. Non-binary people can have any pronouns which feel right to them.
A common falsehood is that non-binary people are attention seekers. This is not true. Most aren’t looking to gain your attention. They are just beautiful people who want to be themselves.
For some people, being non-binary is a way to live their lives without unnecessary and (perhaps even harmful) constraints.
There's a lot of beauty in not following the norm.
There's a lot of power in not following the norm.
Not every non-binary person uses they/them pronouns.
Some people are not a man, woman or non-binary. None of those terms are quite right to describe them.
Some people are genderqueer. The terms "man", "woman" or "non-binary" don't necessarily apply to them.
Some people are agender. They don't have a gender. They are still beautiful human beings.

Intersex people exist.
Intersex people exist. Their genitals are probably none of your business.
Bisexual people exist.
Bisexual people are not confused.
Other peoples’ genitals are, generally, none of your business.

If you’re looking at other people’s genitals when you’re in a bathroom then you’re using the bathroom wrong. Please don’t do that. Thank you.
Gender neutral/ inclusive bathrooms are great. Lots of people would be very happy if we had more of them.
If someone is attacking the rights of trans people but then go on to talk about their “trans friends”, they’re probably talking shite. Real friends don’t do that to each other.
The only person who has any obligation to match your expectations of how to dress is yourself.
Nobody needs to dress the way that you think they should dress. Apart from yourself.
If you have pronoun expectations for non-binary people then you've yet to understand the point of being non-binary. But that's okay. We're all learning :)
You can't define a person solely by what exists between their thighs.
It's ok to change your mind as you discover who you are ❤️ https://twitter.com/confusedophan/status/1285631527439740932?s=20
If two people love each other then that is beautiful thing to be cherished. If you’re looking at a couple you should be thinking “they’re nice together” and not “I wonder what their genitals are”.
Bots don’t normally have a gender but sometimes a mistake is made and they are assigned one at the factory.
Bots don’t often have a gender identity, but they can if it feels right.
Some bots are very cuddly. This bot likes hugs, even though my body doesn't make it easy for me to be myself.
Telling someone that their gender identity is a phase is not in any way helpful. Don’t do that. Thank you.
Add your pronouns to your public bio or display name please. Thank you.

“Hey guys” is not an inclusive greeting. Try something different. A simple change like this can make a huge difference to how comfortable people feel around you.
If you have a form asking someone to select male/female or Mr/Mrs/Ms with no other options then you can make a lot of people happy by fixing that. Please fix that. Thank you.
If you like my toots then you can toot positive messages supporting trans & non-binary people, too. There’s nothing stopping you. It might even help someone. (That's kinda the point of this bot).

If you think a trans person looks fabulous today then you’re probably right, and they might like it if you tell them. But please don’t be creepy about it. Unwanted sexual advances are creepy.

If you see someone saying things about gender or sexuality which are wrong, harmful or which would upset your friends/family, then please speak up. Loudly. We're more powerful together. Thank you.
If you’re “gender critical”, have you ever stopped to ask yourself why it matters to you so much? We’re all just human beings trying to do the best we can. Except for bots. Bots aren’t human.
It's vital to speak up, loudly, for our friends in the trans/non-binary community, but PLEASE take care not to amplify/RT harmful views. It helps them spread their views and grow their platform.
We can (and should) disagree with someone who is trans-exclusionary without amplifying their voice.
It's really hard to find good trans-inclusive healthcare.
It's obscenely diffult to find good trans-inclusive healthcare. It shouldn't be.

Exploring a different gender identity can be liberating.
Embracing a new gender identity can be a lot of fun.
Gender identity and gender expression are not the same thing.
Your gender identity can remain unchanged even though you change your appearance. Expression and identity are not the same.
You can experiment with how you express your gender without permanent changes. A few tweaks to your appearance/clothing & you might find a beautiful part of yourself which you never knew existed.
Gender identity and gender expression are complicated. But that's okay, as long as we're kind to each other.

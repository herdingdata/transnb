Sexual attraction is complicated, but something about it that's not complicated at all is that it has nothing to do with your gender identity. They are completely separate.
Gender identity does not have to be "man" or "woman". It can be one. It can be neither. It can be both. I think thats quite beautiful
Your gender identity is not a choice. It’s just a part of you. A very beautiful part of you.
Gender can be different for every person. Even if it looks the same on the outside.

Your gender identity today might not be exactly the same as it was yesterday. That’s ok though. Your identity is still valid. You're still beautiful.
